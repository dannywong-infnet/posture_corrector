# Real-Time AI Posture Corrector
This project uses computer vision and the MediaPipe Pose estimation library to monitor a user's sitting posture in real-time via a webcam. 
It is designed to detect three common posture issues—shoulder tilt, vertical slouching, and lateral leaning—and provides audio/visual feedback when posture deteriorates below a personalized, calibrated baseline.
